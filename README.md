  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello! My name is Henry Graves, I am a Computer Science major at CSU Chico.
  This is my UX portfolio for CSCI 431 Usability Engineering.
  I am fairly interested in this class as coding software is already something I can do, however, design
  has always come second to me, having some solid foundation for an approach to UI/UX other than "I think this looks alright" 
  will be very nice to utilize in future projects.

<b><h3> The Discord User's Experience </h3></b>
<h4>By Henry Graves | 2/25/2020</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discord above all else, is a communication app. Many users of the app are game focused, however, 
it's use cases stretch from games to school classes to professional project collaboration. In this entry I will describe 
my experience using Discord, the goals I had, my interactions with the app, as well as what the outcomes were. <br />
