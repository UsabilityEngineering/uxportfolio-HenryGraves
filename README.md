&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello! My name is Henry Graves, I am a Computer Science major at CSU Chico. <br />
This is my UX portfolio for CSCI 431 Usability Engineering. <br />
I am fairly interested in this class as coding software is already something I can do, however, design <br />
has always come second to me, having some solid foundation for an approach to UI/UX other than "I think this looks alright" <br />
will be very nice to utilize in future projects.
